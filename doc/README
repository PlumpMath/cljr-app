@Clojure
 - Is a dialect for Lisp, Lisp is a special langauge. 
 - Is homoiconic with almost no syntax.
 - Has a full macrosystem also supports metaprogramming. 
 - Is a functional language with first-class functions.
 - Immutable data structures.
 - Inbuilt concurrency semantics. 
 - Hosted on the extremely mature and performant JavaVM.
 - Seamless interoperability with Java code.
 - General purpose as well as dynamic programming language.
 - Excellently suited for domain-specific langaue style of programming.

@Clojure unique features
 1. Immutability.
 2. Higer-order functions.
 3. Laziness.
 4. Excellent concurrency semantics.
 5. Software Transaction Memory.

@Clojure coding guidelines
 1. Start every source file with a namespace declaration using ns.
 2. Use :import and :use expression in ns to describe the classes and namespaces it depends on.
 3. Always use :only option of :use to make it clear which symbols you need from the other namespace.
 4. Reuse good names, add the :refer-clojure expression to ns if needed.
 5. Structure your source files to avoid the need for forward declarations. Place "primiti" definations near the top and the "composite" definations that depend on them toward the bottom.
